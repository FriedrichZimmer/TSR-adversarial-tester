# Bestbox

The bestbox is a detector result, that can be used for cropping of any set of resulting images. 
This box_results.csv was created based on the results of a CARLA TSR adversarial benchmark run of the No_Entry traccic sign and the 10_mblur_low camera. 
The detections ere made with the Detector model from Yousuf. This file was chosen, as it was the result with the most results. 
Two false positives have been removed from the original result.

It is also possible to use csv file containing ground ground truth or any other detection result.
